This repository contains my work on an assignment for my Computer Graphics class.
The project is a graphics showcase. The only 'gameplay' consists of camera controls.
The project showcases an intermediate understanding of C++ and implementations of both 'old-school' vertex-based meshes and imported ones.

The excel sheet in the root folder contains my own evaluation on the quality of the code!

To run, clone the project and run through Visual Studio or another IDE.
